Redux (for better state management):

store ---> Stores all the states for easier data access. 

Reducers ---> update and change the things. Similar to a controller

useSelector ----> Used to select things from the store

useDispatch ----> Used to update things from the store. useDispatch calls the specific reducer to complete this operation. 

createSlice ----> Used to track the initial state of the store and all the reducers.





Back-end Structure:

index.js ---> Import all the required libraries and setting up the configurations. Also define all the routes
models -----> Define the mongodb schemas. 
controllers ---> Main handling and response logics
middleware ---> check the autenthication and if the user is logged into the application (uses jwt and verifies token)
